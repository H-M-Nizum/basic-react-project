1. JSX Conventions------------------------------
    i) Return a single parent element in JSX
    ii) Implement js directly in JSX
    iii) All Tags self-close in JSX
    iv) ClassName and HTMLFor, not class and for in JSX
    v) Write all HTML Attributes in camelCase in JSX
    vi) Write Inline Styles as Objects in JSX

2. Passing Props to a component-------------------
    i) The term 'props' is an abbreviation for 'properties'
    ii) used for passing data from one component to another.
    iii) Props are being passed in a uni-directional flow means one way from parent to child.
    iv) Props data in read-onlly, which means that data comming from 
        the parent should not be changed by child components. 
    
3. React Hook--------------------------------
    i) React Hook is a feature in the react library that allows developer
    to use state and other React features in functional component.
    which were previously only available in class componenets.
    ii) Hooks can be used to manage state, handle side effects, 
    and access lifecycle methods in functional components.
    iii) There are several built-in-hooks provided by react,
        Such as 
            a) useState
            b) useEffect
            c) useContext
            d) useRef
    iv) React hooks have greatly simplified the development process in
    react and have made it easier to write reusable and composable code.


4. UseRef()-------------------------------
    i)The useRef Hook allows to persist values between renders.
    ii) It can be used to store a mutable value taht does not cause
        a re-render when updated.
    iii) It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
